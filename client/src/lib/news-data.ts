    excerpt: "Kabianga Farmers Cooperative Society has acquired a tuk tuk to support the transportation of milk and animal feeds, marking a significant step towards improving efficiency in dairy farming operations.",
    content: `Kabianga, Kericho County — Kabianga Farmers Cooperative Society has acquired a tuk tuk to support the transportation of milk and animal feeds, marking a significant step towards improving efficiency in dairy farming operations.

The new tuk tuk will be used to collect milk from farmers and deliver it to designated collection and cooling points, ensuring timely delivery and reducing post-harvest losses. In addition, the vehicle will play a key role in distributing animal feeds to farmers, especially in areas where access has previously been a challenge.

The acquisition is part of the cooperative’s broader strategy to strengthen service delivery to its members by reducing transport costs, improving reliability, and enhancing overall productivity within the dairy value chain.

Previously, farmers relied on costly and sometimes unreliable transport options, which affected timely milk delivery and feed supply. The tuk tuk, known for its fuel efficiency and ability to navigate rural roads, is expected to provide a practical and sustainable transport solution.

Members of the cooperative have welcomed the development, noting that improved logistics will contribute to better milk quality, reduced spoilage, and increased farmer incomes.

Kabianga Farmers Cooperative Society continues to invest in infrastructure and assets that support farmers, reaffirming its commitment to empowering dairy producers and promoting sustainable agricultural growth in the region.`,

    content: `Kabianga, Kericho County — The Kenya Jobs & Economic Transformation (KJET) Programme is currently conducting a Farmers Mentorship Training at Kabianga Farmers Cooperative Society, aimed at strengthening farmer capacity, improving productivity, and promoting sustainable agribusiness growth.

The training is being implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Trade and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSEA), KJET, and Edmany Consultancy, bringing together key stakeholders committed to transforming Kenya’s agricultural value chains.

The Farmers Mentorship Program focuses on equipping dairy and crop farmers with practical skills in modern farming techniques, agribusiness management, value addition, record keeping, market access, and financial literacy. Through hands-on mentorship, farmers are guided on how to increase yields, improve quality, reduce post-harvest losses, and access better markets.

Speaking during the training, facilitators emphasized the importance of farmer mentorship in creating jobs, boosting household incomes, and driving local economic development. The program aligns with the Government of Kenya’s broader agenda of supporting MSMEs and empowering cooperatives as engines of rural growth.

Officials from Kabianga Farmers Cooperative Society welcomed the initiative, noting that such capacity-building programs enhance farmer confidence, improve cooperative performance, and strengthen the entire dairy value chain in the region.

The partnership between KJET, the Ministry of Trade and MSEA, and Edmany Consultancy underscores a shared commitment to empowering farmers with knowledge, skills, and networks needed to thrive in a competitive agricultural economy.

As the training continues, participating farmers are expected to apply the acquired skills on their farms, contributing to increased productivity, improved livelihoods, and sustainable economic transformation in Kericho County and beyond.`,
